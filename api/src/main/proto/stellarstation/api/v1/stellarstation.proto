// The public API service of StellarStation, a system supporting communication between satellites

// satellites that the operator does not own or plans they have not reserved.
// Only using IDs shown on the StellarStation Console or returned in API responses will ensure all
// inputs are valid.
//
// A pass is a time range where an ground station and satellite can communicate with each other, i.e.,
// the period between Acquisition of Signal (AOS) and Loss of Signal (LOS) of the ground station and
// satellite pair.
//
// A plan is a scheduled pass that will be executed to send and receive data between the ground
// station and satellite during the time range.
