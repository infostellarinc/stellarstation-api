# fakemodem

This is a Go application that implements a fake ground station modem
using the ground station API.

The intention of this application is to allow a ground station to mimic
the responses that would be generated by a satellite.

It also demonstrates how to integrate custom hardware using the
StellarStation ground station API.

To build:

``` shell
$ go build
```

Example configuration:

``` json
{
    "GroundStations": [
        {
            "Name": "testoffice-01",
            "ID": "9",
            "Address": "testoffice-01:443",
            "Key": "api-key.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

Notes on the configuration:
- The `Name` value is used for logging purposes only.
- The `ID` value should be either the ground station ID as provided by StellarStation.
- The `Address` field should be the hostname (or IP address) and port number of the StarPass device.
- The `Key` field should be the file name of your API key.
