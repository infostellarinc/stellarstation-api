# fakemodem

This is a golang application that implements a fake ground station modem
using the ground station API.

The intention of this application is to allow a ground station to mimic
the responses that would be generated by a satellite.

It also demonstrates how to integrate custom hardware using the
StellarStation ground station API.

To build:

``` shell
$ go build
```

Example configuration:

``` json
{
    "GroundStations": [
        {
            "Name": "testoffice-01",
            "ID": "9",
            "Address": "testoffice-01:443",
            "Key": "api-key.json"
        },
    ],
    "Satellites": [
        {
            "Name": "test",
            "ID": "112",
            "Channels": [
                {
                    "Name": "UHF Down",
                    "ID": "12",
                    "Telemetry": "test.bin"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
